Predicting the next big thing using "Social Media Analytics". This repository has our idea to manage the shipment of mobiles using a forecasting model which predicts the sales of each model just from tweets. 
Note: 
1. Extracting-data.ipynb has the code to extract the tweets from twitter API,
2. Research Papers folder has all the references we used to build the Deep Learning Mobile Forecaster(DLMF),
3. Iphone notebook has the simple forecaster to predict the sales of Iphone(but due to limit of twitter API we were able to prove our hypothesis to an extent, may be in the coming future this project can be taken to next step.)
